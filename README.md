## ABOUT

This repository contains a simple game developed using the Godot Engine. The game was developed following the [How to make a Video Game - Godot Beginner Tutorial](https://youtu.be/LOhfqjmasi0?si=FOhDy-tuMkdaqCuv) tutorial by [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/c/Brackeys). The game is a platformer where you avoid falling and collect coins.
